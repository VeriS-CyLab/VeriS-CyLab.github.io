### ![corina] Corina Pasareanu, ACM Distinguished Scientist

I am doing research in software engineering at NASA Ames, in the Robust Software Engineering group. I am employed by Carnegie Mellon University, where I am Associate Research Professor with CMU CyLab at the Silicon Valley campus. I also hold a courtesy appointment with the CMU ECE department.

### ![kasper] Kasper SÃ¸e Luckow, *Postdoctoral Researcher*
**Email:** [kasper.luckow@sv.cmu.edu](mailto:kasper.luckow@sv.cmu.edu)  
**Website:** [https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kluckow](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/kluckow)

Researching for the Integrated Symbolic Execution for the [Space-Time Analysis of Code (ISSTAC)]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link projects.md %}) project (funded by [DARPA STAC](http://www.darpa.mil/program/space-time-analysis-for-cybersecurity)). I also worked on a NASA project on safety analysis of flight critical systems. My current focus is on identifying algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities using symbolic execution with heuristic exploration.

#### Research Interests
- *Symbolic Analysis:* I work on [Symbolic PathFinder](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/wiki/projects/jpf-symbc), a symbolic execution engine built on the software model checker [Java PathFinder](http://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf). I also maintain [JDart](https://github.com/psycopaths/jdart), a dynamic symbolic execution engine.
- *Probabilistic Software Analysis:* I'm working on analysis of software placed in stochastic environments, e.g., with the goal of quantifying how *likely* a target event is to occur.
- *Machine Learning:* I'm investigating how to leverage machine learning techniques as a heuristic for symbolic analysis. I also used machine learning for mining log data from flight-critical systems.

### ![sang] Quoc-Sang Phan, *Postdoctoral Researcher*
**Website:** [http://qsphan.github.io/](http://qsphan.github.io/)

My research aims to analyse programs and provide a quantitative assessment of security. To this end, I use symbolic execution for program analysis, and model counting for quantification of information.
